## Objectives ##

Simulate a simple virtual memory system using the three page replacement 
algorithms studied in class: First-In First-Out (FIFO), Optimal, and Least Recently Used (LRU). 
Your program reads an input file containing a sequence of page requests (page numbers) 
and generates an output that shows how the requested pages are mapped into physical frames.

## How Do I Run This? ##

`proj4 input file [FIFO|LRU|OPT]`
Invalid Input should be caught and the program will exit.

## Sample and  Outputs  ## 

Sample input file and expected outputs are shown below. You can use it to verify your results.
Example: Here is an example input file and the corresponding outputs. The input has 8 pages, 4 frames,
and 12 page requests.
